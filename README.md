### Key Parameters

Edit the configuration section in the script:

```python
# Motor Parameters
POWER_HP = 800              # Motor horsepower
VOLTAGE = 460               # Line-to-line voltage (V)

POLES = 4                   # Number of poles

# System Parameters
INERTIA = 150               # System inertia (kg·m²)
LOAD_TORQUE_FACTOR = 0.75   # Load as fraction of rated torque

# VFD Parameters
RAMP_TIME = 30              # Startup ramp time (seconds)
V_BOOST = 0.15              # Low-frequency voltage boost (15%)

# Load Type (v3.0.0 only)
LOAD_TYPE = 'constant_torque'  # Options: 'constant_torque', 'fan_pump', 'constant_power'

```

## 📈 Load Types

### Constant Torque
**Applications:** Conveyors, hoists, positive displacement pumps, extruders
```python
LOAD_TYPE = 'constant_torque'
```
- Torque remains relatively constant with speed
- Most demanding for VFD starting

### Fan/Pump (Quadratic)
**Applications:** Centrifugal fans, centrifugal pumps, blowers
```python
LOAD_TYPE = 'fan_pump'
```
- Torque proportional to speed²
- Easiest to start, lowest energy consumption

### Constant Power
**Applications:** Machine tools, winders, center-driven winders
```python
LOAD_TYPE = 'constant_power'
```
- Torque inversely proportional to speed
- Challenging at low speeds

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Motor Model

The simulation uses a first-order induction motor model with:

**Torque-Slip Characteristic:**
```
T/T_rated = (a·s) / (s² + b·s + c)
```
where:
- `a = 2.5` (peak torque multiplier)
- `b = 0.15` (torque curve shape)
- `c = 0.08` (starting torque adjustment)
- `s` = slip

**Constant V/f Control:**
- Voltage and frequency scale linearly
- Maintains constant magnetic flux
- Low-frequency voltage boost for starting torque

**Equation of Motion:**
```
J·(dω/dt) = T_em - T_load - D·ω
```

### Key Assumptions

1. **Simplified Current Model** - Based on torque and magnetizing components
2. **Constant V/f Ratio** - Typical for general-purpose VFD operation
3. **Fixed Power Factor** - 0.88 assumed throughout startup
4. **Linear Ramp** - Frequency increases linearly from 0 to 60 Hz
5. **Ideal VFD** - No switching harmonics or dead-time effects

- **IEEE standards** for motor starting

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I use this for motors other than 800HP?**  
A: Yes! Simply change `POWER_HP` and adjust `INERTIA` accordingly. For rough estimation: `INERTIA ≈ 0.2 × POWER_HP`

**Q: Why does VFD use more energy than DOL?**  
A: The longer ramp time means more time operating at low efficiency. However, the energy difference (~$0.20) is negligible compared to benefits.

**Q: Can I simulate frequency > 60Hz?**  
A: Yes, but the model assumes constant V/f. For field weakening (>60Hz), additional modifications are needed.

**Q: How accurate is the DOL comparison?**  
A: The DOL model is simplified but representative. Actual DOL behavior varies with grid strength and motor design.

**Q: Can I use this for motor braking/deceleration?**  
A: Current version models acceleration only. Braking requires regenerative/dynamic braking models.
