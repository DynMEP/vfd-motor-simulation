## 📊 Configuration

### Key Parameters

Edit the configuration section in the script:

```python
# Motor Parameters
POWER_HP = 800              # Motor horsepower
VOLTAGE = 460               # Line-to-line voltage (V)
BASE_FREQ = 60              # Base frequency (Hz)
POLES = 4                   # Number of poles

# System Parameters
INERTIA = 150               # System inertia (kg·m²)
LOAD_TORQUE_FACTOR = 0.75   # Load as fraction of rated torque

# VFD Parameters
VFD_RAMP_TIME = 30          # VFD startup ramp time (seconds)
V_BOOST = 0.15              # Low-frequency voltage boost (15%)

# Soft Starter Parameters
SOFT_START_RAMP_TIME = 20   # Soft starter ramp time (seconds)

```

## 📈 Load Types

### Constant Torque
**Applications:** Conveyors, hoists, positive displacement pumps, extruders
```python
LOAD_TYPE = 'constant_torque'
```
- Torque remains relatively constant with speed
- Most demanding for motor starting
- Common in material handling and process industries

### Fan/Pump (Quadratic)
**Applications:** Centrifugal fans, centrifugal pumps, blowers
```python
LOAD_TYPE = 'fan_pump'
```
- Torque proportional to speed²
- Easiest to start, lowest energy consumption
- VFD provides maximum energy savings potential

### Constant Power
**Applications:** Machine tools, winders, center-driven winders
```python
LOAD_TYPE = 'constant_power'
```
- Torque inversely proportional to speed
- Challenging at low speeds
- Requires careful motor and drive sizing

## 🔬 Technical Details

### Motor Model

The simulation uses a first-order induction motor model with:

**Torque-Slip Characteristic:**
```
T/T_rated = (a·s) / (s² + b·s + c)
```
where:
- `a = 2.5` (peak torque multiplier)
- `b = 0.15` (torque curve shape)
- `c = 0.08` (starting torque adjustment)
- `s` = slip

**VFD Control (Constant V/f):**
- Voltage and frequency scale linearly
- Maintains constant magnetic flux
- Low-frequency voltage boost for starting torque
- Frequency ramp from 0 to 60 Hz

**Soft Starter Control (SCR Voltage Control):**
- Full frequency (60 Hz) operation
- Voltage ramp via SCR phase-angle control
- Torque scales with voltage squared (V²)
- Bypassed after startup (zero continuous losses)

**Equation of Motion:**
```
J·(dω/dt) = T_em - T_load - D·ω
```

### Key Assumptions

1. **Simplified Current Model** - Based on torque and magnetizing components
2. **VFD: Constant V/f Ratio** - Typical for general-purpose VFD operation
3. **Soft Starter: Voltage Control** - SCR phase-angle control with V² torque relationship
4. **Fixed Power Factor** - 0.88 assumed throughout startup
5. **Linear Ramps** - VFD frequency and soft starter voltage increase linearly
6. **Ideal Devices** - No switching harmonics or dead-time effects modeled

### Performance Comparison

| Parameter | VFD | Soft Starter | Winner |
|-----------|-----|--------------|--------|
| Peak Current | 1.23× FLA | 3.30× FLA | VFD |
| Installed Cost | $70,000 | $15,000 | Soft Starter |
| Annual Operating Cost | $14,505 | $300 | Soft Starter |
| Continuous Losses | 3-6% | 0% (bypassed) | Soft Starter |
| Speed Control | Yes | No | VFD |
| Starting Time | 30s | 20s | Soft Starter |
| Complexity | High | Low | Soft Starter |
| Reliability | Good | Excellent | Soft Starter |

## ❓ FAQ

**Q: Can I use this for motors other than 800HP?**  
A: Yes! Simply change `POWER_HP` and adjust `INERTIA` accordingly. For rough estimation: `INERTIA ≈ 0.2 × POWER_HP`

**Q: Why does VFD have higher operating costs than soft starter?**  
A: VFDs have continuous losses (3-6%) because they're always in the circuit. Soft starters are bypassed after startup, so they have zero continuous losses. However, if you use VFD speed control to reduce motor speed, the energy savings far exceed the VFD losses.

**Q: Which method should I choose for my application?**  
A: **Constant speed forever?** → Soft Starter (best value). **Any variable speed needs?** → VFD (energy savings justify cost). **Weak electrical system?** → VFD (lowest inrush). Use the simulation to compare for your specific parameters!

**Q: Can I simulate frequency > 60Hz?**  
A: Yes, but the model assumes constant V/f. For field weakening (>60Hz), additional modifications are needed to handle the flux reduction region.

**Q: How accurate is the soft starter model?**  
A: The soft starter current model is simplified during the voltage ramp but provides realistic peak currents (3-4× FLA) and overall behavior. For detailed harmonic analysis, more sophisticated models would be needed.

**Q: Can I use this for motor braking/deceleration?**  
A: Current version models acceleration only. Braking requires regenerative/dynamic braking models and would be a good future enhancement.

**Q: What about other starting methods (autotransformer, wye-delta)?**  
A: Version 4.0 focuses on the most practical modern comparison (VFD vs Soft Starter). Other methods could be added based on community interest!

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**ImportError: No module named 'scipy'**
```bash
pip install --upgrade scipy
```

**Plots not displaying**
- Ensure you have a display backend: `pip install PyQt5` or check if tkinter is installed
- On headless servers, save plots instead of displaying:
  ```python
  # Add before plt.show()
  plt.savefig('vfd_simulation_output.png', dpi=300, bbox_inches='tight')
  ```

**CSV file encoding issues**
- Open with UTF-8 encoding in Excel: Data → Get Data → From Text/CSV → File Origin: 65001 (UTF-8)
- Or use: `pd.read_csv('filename.csv', encoding='utf-8')` in Python

**Negative speed or unstable results**
- Check that `LOAD_TORQUE_FACTOR` < 1.0
- Verify `INERTIA` value is reasonable (typically 0.1-0.3 × POWER_HP for most systems)
- Ensure `V_BOOST` is not too high (recommended: 0.10-0.20)
- Reduce ramp times if motor fails to start

**"RuntimeWarning: invalid value encountered"**
- This can occur at very low frequencies. The simulation handles this automatically, but if persistent:
  - Increase the minimum frequency threshold in `motor_dynamics`
  - Adjust initial conditions

**Figure layout warning**
- The table subplot may trigger a layout warning - this is cosmetic and doesn't affect results
- Already handled in v4.0 with `plt.subplots_adjust()`
